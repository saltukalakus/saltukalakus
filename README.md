## Hi there 👋

### Manifesto for human developers

1- **UX > DX**: Choose the tech stack that delivers the best performance and native feel for the user. Invest that saved time by AI into maintaining separate, high-quality native codebases rather than compromising with cross-platform wrappers.

2- **The Truth Chain**: [Spec → Test → Code] ↺

Treat the Spec and Tests as the 'Truth'. If the AI implementation passes the tests but fails the spec, the implementation is wrong. We don't write code; we solve problems. The code is just the paperwork the AI files to prove the problem is solved. 

Avoid the perfectionism trap. Use the speed of AI to run through the Truth Chain multiple times. Clarity happens through iteration, not just contemplation.

3- **Verify**: Treat AI as a talented but hallucinating developer. Use AI to verify itself. 

4- **Hybrid Security**: AI scans for anomalies; SAST scans for rules. Both run on every commit.

5- **Docs-as-Code**: Feature requests are PRs to the design documentation. We review the intent before we write the implementation.
