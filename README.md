## Hi there 👋

### Manifesto for human developers

1- UX > DX: Use the best tech for the user, not the developer. AI offsets the cost of complexity.

2- The Truth Chain: Spec $\rightarrow$ Test $\rightarrow$ Code. The code is just a mechanism to pass the test.

3- Verify: Treat AI as a talented but hallucinating developer. Use AI to verify itself.

4- Hybrid Security: AI scans for anomalies; SAST scans for rules. Both run on every commit.

5- Docs-as-Code: Feature requests are PRs to the design documentation. We review the intent before we write the implementation.
